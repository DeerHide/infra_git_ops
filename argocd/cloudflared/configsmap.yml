# This ConfigMap is just a way to define the cloudflared config.yaml file in k8s.
# It's useful to define it in k8s, rather than as a stand-alone .yaml file, because
# this lets you use various k8s templating solutions (e.g. Helm charts) to
# parameterize your config, instead of just using string literals.

    # Autoupdates applied in a k8s pod will be lost when the pod is removed or restarted, so

    # The `ingress` block tells cloudflared which local service to route incoming
    # requests to. For more about ingress rules, see
    # https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ingress
    #
    # Remember, these rules route traffic from cloudflared to a local service. To route traffic
    # from the internet to cloudflared, run `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`.
    # E.g. `cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com`.
